WARNING: This is not a tutorial or an example.
         However the "dna_example/" is documented and tested.
	 For new users, try looking there first.

         This directory contains some code used in an old paper
	 (Bellesia et al. Prot.Sci.,19:141-154,2010)
	  measures the probabilities of certain amino acids appearing in in
          helices or sheets.  The goal was to estimate the appropriate
	  energy parameters for a coarse grained protein folding model
	  when those amino acids when the chain adopts a helical or
	  sheet-like conformation.  Unless somebody wants an explanation,
	  I am too lazy to document this old code.
          (This code has not been tested since 2010)

This code appears in this repository because the PDB files read by these
scripts are typically downloaded from the PISCES server (using "dlpisces.py").
