Typical Usage: 

coords2dihedrals.py 180 < 12column_text_file.dat

This script reads a 12-column numeric text file and computes dihedral angles
(and other inclusive angles and distances).  Example input file:

30.13 11.46 15.12 35.28 -2.32 12.61 30.68 -4.45 16.30 28.68 8.46 10.24
28.68 8.42 10.24 30.68 -4.45 16.30 25.22 -4.75 19.42 27.57 3.37 8.06
27.57 3.37 8.06 25.22 -4.75 19.42 20.45 -1.27 20.09 25.80 -2.26 6.61
25.80 -2.23 6.61 20.45 -1.27 20.09 15.47 1.36 18.12 21.67 -5.88 7.17
:
The 12 numbers on each line represent the x,y,z coordinates of 4 atoms
(This is the format of the files generated by the "pdb2coords.py" script.)
For each line, the program calculates the (4-body) dihedral angle for 
these 4 atoms, followed by the (3-body) bond angle between atoms 1,2,3 and 2,3,4
followed by distances between atoms 1,2 and 2,3 and 3,4, and writes them
(in that order) to the standard out.  (6 numbers total, followed by a newline)
(When a line contains the wrong number of numbers, 
 the script prints out a list of 6 impossibe negative values:
 "-720 -360 -360 -1 -1 -1" to let the caller know that 
 this particular angle could not be computed.)

Note:   
The "IUPAC/IUB" dihedral-angle convention is used:
4 atoms in the "trans" conformation have a dihedral angle of 180 degrees.
By default, dihedral angles are calculated in the range from 0 to 360.0 degrees.
(This means there is discontinuity in the angle at 0 degrees.)
However this may be a bad choice for polymers which can alternate between
helical conformations which are left and right handed.
In some cases, you may want to have the discontinuity appear at 180 degrees.
(or some other angle which is sparsely populated).

So you can supply an optional argument (the "branch_of_log") which indicates 
where the discontinuity in the dihedral angle will appear.
Dihedral angles returned by this program will lie in the range: 
[branch_of_log-360, branch_of_log)
