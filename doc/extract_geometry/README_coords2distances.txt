This program reads a 6-column numeric text file and prints a list of distances.
The 6 numbers on each line represent the x,y,z coordinates of 2 atoms.
For each line this program computes the distance between these atom pairs,
and prints it to the standard out.
(When a line contains the wrong number of numbers, this program does not crash.
 Instead an impossible value, -1.0 is printed.)
