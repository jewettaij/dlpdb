Usage:

coords2angles.py < 9column_text_file.dat

This script reads a 9-column numeric text file.  For example:

30.13 11.46 15.12 35.28 -2.32 12.61 30.68 -4.45 16.30
28.68 8.42 10.24 30.68 -4.45 16.30 25.22 -4.75 19.42
27.57 3.37 8.06 25.22 -4.75 19.42 20.45 -1.27 20.09
25.80 -2.23 6.61 20.45 -1.27 20.09 15.47 1.36 18.12
:
The 9 numbers on each line represent the x,y,z coordinates of 3 atoms.
(This is the format of the files generated by the "pdb2coords.py" script.)
For each line, the program calculates the angle between these atoms
followed by distances between atoms 1,2 and 2,3 (in that order)
to the standard out.  (3 numbers total, followed by a newline.)
(When a line contains the wrong number of numbers, 
 the script prints out a list of 3 impossibe negative values: "-360 -1 -1"
 to let the caller know that this particular angle could not be computed
